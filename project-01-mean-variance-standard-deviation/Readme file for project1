## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Build a Python function that:
- Accepts a list of 9 numerical values.
- Converts it into a 3x3 matrix using NumPy.
- Calculates the following:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Sum  
Each of these metrics should be calculated:
- For each column
- For each row
- For the flattened matrix
